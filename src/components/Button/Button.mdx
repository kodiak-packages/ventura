# Button

Buttons make common actions more obvious and help users more easily perform them. Buttons use labels and sometimes icons to communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them.

## Best practices

- Group buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance.
- Ensure that button actions are clear and consistent.
- Select a single button variation and do not mix them.

## Examples

### Basic usage


<Button>Click me</Button>


### Button types


<Button type="primary">Click me</Button>
<br />
<Button type="secondary">Click me</Button>


### Button sizes


<Button size="normal">Click me</Button>
<br />
<Button size="small">Click me</Button>
  <br />
<Button size="large">Click me</Button>


### Button with an onClick function

<Playground>
  <Button onClick={(event) => console.log(`LOGGER: ${event.target}`)}>Click me</Button>
</Playground>

### Button that is disabled

<Playground>
  <Button isDisabled>Submit</Button>
</Playground>

### Button with loading state

<Playground>
  <Button isLoading>Submit</Button>
</Playground>

### Buttons with an icon

Button can be prefixed or suffixed with an Icon.

<Playground>
  <Button suffixIcon={<Activity />}>Insights</Button>
  <br />
  <Button prefixIcon={<Trash2 />}>Remove</Button>
</Playground>
